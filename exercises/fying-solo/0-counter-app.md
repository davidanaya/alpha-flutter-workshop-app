## 0-counter-app

This is the default _Hello World_ project that we get when we create a new Flutter project.

It consists on a single page with a floating button and a counter label. By clicking the button the counter is incremented.

### Objectives

None.

### Pay attention to

- `StatefulWidget` and concept of state

- `MaterialApp` and `Scaffold`
