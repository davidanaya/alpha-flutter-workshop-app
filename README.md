# alpha_flutter_workshop_app

A Flutter project for a workshop.

The app consists on two pages, home shows a list of members inside the Alpha-health organization in github, and by clicking on each of them navigates to a second view where the repos for that member are listed. Clicking on any of the repos opens a web browser with the url for the project.

## Getting Started

For help setting up the environment, please check the [online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/macos).

## Branches

The project has numbered branches that can be used to follow the workshop. Each branch has a related document within the exercises folder with the new functionality and the highlights.

## Exercises

There are 2 different sets of exercises that can be followed during the workshop.

- [help-me-baby](./exercises/help-me-baby/index.md) are very detailed exercises which will lead you through the process with great detail at the beginning (instructions will be reduced as you get to the final steps in the workshop).
- [flying-solo](./exercises/flying-solo/index.md) can be used when you want to face more challenges; intructions here are very loose, even though we will point you to some resources you can use to figure out the solutions yourself.
